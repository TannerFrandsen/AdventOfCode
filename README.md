If you would like to play along see the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

The Event
---------
Each day a challenge will be given.  In a branch corresponding to the year I will post my solution to the challenge.
There will be a folder for each day which will contain the following files `prompt.txt`, `solution.py`, 
and `puzzle_input.dat`. The tests are separate from the code in the `tests` directory.

Here are some of the people I know who are also joining in on the fun!
