If you would like to play along see the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

The Event
---------
Each day a challenge will be given.  In a branch corresponding to the year I will post my solution to the challenge.
All of the prompts will be in a directory called `prompts`. Each solution will be in a directory called 
`solutions` with the file name being the day of the challenge (`day_01.py`, `day_02.py`, etc.).
The puzzle input will be in a directory called `input`.

People I know
-------------
Here are some of the people I know who are also joining in on the fun!
